    <p>Code Clubs give all children the opportunity to learn to code, no matter who they are or where they come from.</p>
    <p>Each week our voluteers set a coding puzzle for our children to complete. The volunteers are on hand to help out when the children run into problems.</p>
    <p>Projects are completed in a number of different technologies, including Scratch, HTML and Python.</p>
    <p>The video below is provided by Code Club, and gives you an idea of how the club operates.</p>
